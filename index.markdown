I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon and my research intersects the
fields of scientific visualization and high performance computing. I am advised by
[Prof. Hank Childs](https://cdux.cs.uoregon.edu/childs.html)
and I am a part of the [CDUX research group](https://cdux.cs.uoregon.edu/index.html).
My research is primarily driven by contributing the open-source scientific visualization library [VTK-m](https://m.vtk.org/).

Before the U of O, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at eQ Technologic (India),
developing ETL tools that enabled business intelligence and data migration capabilities.
I got my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Information Technology from the University of Pune in 2013.

Outside my academic and career pursuits, I am passionate about Crossfit and the outdoors.
My love for the outdoors stems from the fact that I'm a Punekar (Puneite) and have grown up exploring
and scaling the forts around Maharashtra and the mountains in the Sahyadris.
I've been enjoying crossfit and olympic weightlifting since 2019.
