I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Univerisity of Oregon and my research intersects the
fields of scientific visualization and high performance computing. I am advised by
Prof. Hank Childs and I am a part of the CDUX research group. My research is primarily
driven by contributing the open-source scientific visualization library VTK-m.

Before the U of O, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at eQ Technologic (India),
develping ETL tools that enabled business intelligence and data migration capabilities.
I got my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Information Technology from the University of Pune in 2013.

Outside my academic and career persuits, I am passionate about Crossfit and the outdoors.
My love for the outdoors stems from the fact that I'm a Punekar (Puneite) and have grown up exploring
all scaling the forts in Maharashtra and the mountains of the Sahyadris.
I've been enjoying crossfit and olympic weightlifting since 2019.
